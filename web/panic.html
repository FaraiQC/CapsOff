        <h1 class="top">How to stop panicking in exams</h1> </br>
        <p class="color">There is LITERALLY NOTHING WORSE than that feeling of looking at a question and going completely blank. Like you have no idea what‚Äôs going on and you start to PANIC. Let‚Äôs do a bit of unpacking and try help you avoid that feeling for good.</p></b>
        <h1>Okay so firstly, what‚Äôs the point of an exam?</h1></br>
        <pclass="color">In an exam you have one goal, and one goal only: get the most marks in the least time.</p>
        <p>This is the ONLY important thing.</p>
        <h1>
            How do I get the most most marks in the least time?</h1>
        <p>By doing all the easy questions first.

            Practically what this means is that if you get stuck on a question for more than five minutes and you think you might get it wrong you should move on. You absolutely don‚Äôt want to waste half an hour on a tough question you might get wrong and then run out of time for easy questions you could have gotten right.
            
            So when you get stuck, circle a question, move on, and come back at the end when you have time.</p>
            <h1>What if I still don‚Äôt understand when I come back?</h1>
            <p>While teachers can make exam questions really hard, they can‚Äôt test you on stuff that isn‚Äôt in the syllabus.

                So if you are looking at a question and you have no idea what‚Äôs going on you should do three things:
                
                Work out what part of the syllabus this question relates to
                Start writing down everything you can think of related to that section (if your exam has process marks you might even get some points for this ‚Äì for example in physics you can get a mark for identifying the correct formula)
                See if you can related the question to any of the things you‚Äôve written down. You might not get the right answer, but you want to at least try and get a few marks. Ideally of course while writing stuff down you‚Äôll actually figure out the correct answer. But if you don‚Äôt this process will still help you get the most marks in the least time.
                </p>
                <h1>Bonus ü§ñü§ñü§ñ</h1>
                <p>If you want to get really good at this technique, do a timed past paper. Get a sibling or parent to be an ‚Äúinvigillator‚Äù who makes sure you don‚Äôt look at the memo or any textbooks while you practice, and see what marks you get in the allocated time.

                    This will also help you realise which areas you need to do more practice in, and what you don‚Äôt understand. So it should help with studying and with exam technique üòÑüòÑüòÑ
                    
                    Keep studying, don‚Äôt give up, you got this. üíñ</p>
